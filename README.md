# classify_iris_dataset
This script is used for the simmple demonstration of performance and implementation of various machine learning algorithms on the famouse iris dataset.
The steps used in hte above script are as follows:

1. imports are done 

we have imported the modules required for the implementation of various machine learning algorithms as 

pandas :- pip install pandas 
pandas.tools.plotting 
matplotlib :- pip install matplotlib
sklearn :- pip import scikit-learn

2. getting the dataset

there are two ways to get the iris dataset

a) load the dataste through the sklearn.dataset module 
b) get through the direct link :- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data

we have used the second method for getting the dataset 

3. the dataset 

the famose iris dataset is fairly simple dataset, it conatins the petal and sepal lenght and width of three flowers in the 150 rows and 4 columns 
this is bassically a classification problem where we have to predict the class of the flower based on its attributes.

4. loading the datset

we have used the pandas dataframe as our primary data structure as dataframe is nothing but collection of rows and columns.

5. insights 

we have shown the relationships between the various  attributes in the dataset through the matplotlib graphs.

6. descriptive analysis 

we have first validated the dataset
